## üîç About me
I am currently in the third year of my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems at UTFPR. I have a technical course in IT from ETEC and have been interning in the field at Justi√ßa Federal do Paran√° since 2023. Additionally, I studied Computer Science for a year and a half at Universidade Positivo until the pandemic, when I decided to pursue new challenges.

## üíº Experience
### IT Intern | Justi√ßa Federal do Paran√° | May 2023 - April 2025 
I worked in direct user support, assisting with the installation and maintenance of hardware and software, which allowed me to develop my problem-solving skills and interpersonal skills by interacting with a wide range of users. After some time, I had the opportunity to work with MECM, where I assisted in creating PowerShell scripts for the installation and uninstallation of applications for end users via Software Center. This task enabled me to gain knowledge in scripting and the functionality of the MECM tool.
### Student | ETEC Centro Paula Souza | July 2017 - December 2018
During the course, I worked on many projects, but I will focus on the final project, where our team, consisting of four members, developed a website that allowed freelancers such as masons, electricians, painters, gardeners, and plumbers to search for jobs on a platform that intermediates repair requests. The entire project included a MySQL database, a website, a mobile application programmed in Java, and a C# program responsible for managing the website content. I was responsible for programming the administration application, which was integrated with the database, while also assisting the team in the development of the website.
